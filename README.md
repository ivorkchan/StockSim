## Use Cases and User Stories

### Use Case 1: User Registration

User Story: As a new user, I want to create a new account so that I can log into the app and start trading. To sign up/register, I need to choose a userID and a password.

- Interactor: RegistrationInteractor
- Controller: RegistrationController
- Presenter: RegistrationView
- Steps:
  - The user selects "Register" and inputs the required information (View -> Controller).
  - The RegistrationController loads the registration info to the Interactor. The Interactor verifies data compliance and creates a new account (Controller -> Interactor).
  - If registration is successful, the RegistrationInteractor instructs the RegistrationView to display a success message and guide the user to log in (Controller -> Presenter).
